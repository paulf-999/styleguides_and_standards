# Python Style Guide

Here's a Python style guide that follows the commonly accepted conventions and best practices:

## 1. Naming Conventions

* Module names: `lowercase_with_underscores.py`
* Package names: `lowercase_with_underscores`
* Class names: `CamelCase`
* Function and method names: `lowercase_with_underscores`
* Variable names: `lowercase_with_underscores`
* Constants: `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`

---

## 2. Code Layout

* Use 4 spaces for indentation (avoid tabs).
* Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
* Use a newline after imports and before the class or function definition.
* Separate methods and classes with two blank lines.
* Use a single space around operators and after commas.

---

## 3. Imports

* Import modules on separate lines.
* Use absolute imports whenever possible.
* Avoid wildcard imports (`from module import *`).
* Place imports in the following order: standard library modules, third-party modules, local modules.

---

## 4. Comments

* Use inline comments sparingly and keep them concise.
* Use docstrings to document modules, classes, methods, and functions.
* Write clear, self-explanatory code and minimize the need for comments.

---

## 5. Strings

* Use single quotes for string literals.
* Use double quotes inside strings to avoid escaping.
* Use triple quotes for docstrings and multi-line strings.

---

## 6. Function and Method Definitions

* Define function parameters without spaces around the equals sign.
* Use a single space after the comma in function definitions.
* Place default arguments at the end of the argument list.

---

## 7. Control Structures

* Use a space after commas in control structures (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`).
* Avoid unnecessary parentheses around conditions.
* Use a blank line before a `return` statement if it improves readability.

---

## 8. Error Handling

* Prefer specific exceptions over catching all exceptions (`except Exception:`).
* Use `try-except-else` blocks when possible.
* Use `finally` blocks sparingly and only when necessary.

---

## 9. Miscellaneous

* Use meaningful variable and function names.
* Avoid using mutable types as default arguments.
* Use list comprehensions and generator expressions for concise and readable code.
* Follow [PEP 8 guidelines](https://pep8.org/) for any conventions not covered here.


Remember, consistency is key when it comes to style guides. It's essential to follow the established style within a project or organization to maintain code readability and maintainability.
